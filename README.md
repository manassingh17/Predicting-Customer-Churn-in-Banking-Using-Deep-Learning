# Predicting Customer Churn in Banking Using Deep Learning

## Overview

In today's competitive banking environment, retaining customers is crucial for sustaining business growth and profitability. Customer churn, or the loss of clients, can have significant financial implications for banks. This project aims to develop a deep learning model to predict whether a customer will exit from a bank based on various factors.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises various features that can influence a customer's decision to leave the bank. The features include:

- **Surname**: The last name of the customer.
- **CreditScore**: The credit score of the customer.
- **Geography**: The geographical location of the customer.
- **Gender**: The gender of the customer.
- **Age**: The age of the customer.
- **Tenure**: The number of years the customer has been with the bank.
- **Balance**: The current balance in the customer's account.
- **NumOfProducts**: The number of products the customer has with the bank.
- **HasCrCard**: Whether the customer has a credit card.
- **IsActiveMember**: Whether the customer is an active member of the bank.
- **EstimatedSalary**: The estimated annual salary of the customer.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook or any preferred IDE
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Deployment**: Streamlit

## Objective

By leveraging deep learning techniques, this project aims to provide a powerful tool for banks to predict customer churn accurately. The insights derived from this model will help the bank enhance its customer retention strategies, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction and increased profitability.
